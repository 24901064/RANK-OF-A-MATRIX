# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1. Start
2. import the numpy library to handle matrix operations
3. define the matrix with the given elements:
4. print the rank
5. end
## Program:
import numpy as np


matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [3, 6, 9]])


rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)

print(f"The rank of the matrix is: {rank}")



## Output:
